Tetris is a block-based puzzle game wherein blocks have to be placed in such an arrangement that the free-space between various blocks is minimized. The game has been studied as a part of artificial intelligence and various algorithms have been designed to minimize the free-space. One such algorithm is Bin-Packing Algorithm. To give an overview, the game consists of blocks of various shapes. These blocks appear one at a time and they have to be placed in such a way that there is no free space between two nearby blocks. If at any time, a row consists of no free space, then the row gets vanished. The game ends when there is no space for block to be put.
Second version adds sound to the game.
